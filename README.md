# Discord.Js Bot Template
Written by: Chujia Guo

This project is my attempt at making a discord bot template. It can be reused to make multiple bots without starting from scratch.

Features:
- Custom Command Ready
- Has some basic commands such as `ping` and `help`
- Commands have permissions enabled.
